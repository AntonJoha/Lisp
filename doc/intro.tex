\section{Idea}

The idea behind this is for me to get a more hand-on experience with programming languages, lisp and all that it entails. 
There's not a clear end goal at the moment and in no way intended to be an alternative programming language. 
It's instead more for the sake of me learning. 

This also means that this document is mostly made for me and no one else i.e some parts may be sloppy, others may not be finished.
