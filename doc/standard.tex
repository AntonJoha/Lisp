\section{Standard library}

This chapter is meant to document all of the different functions that reside in the standard library. 
There is no real plan for what is to be added and when. 
But when new features arrive they should be added here. 
There's an issue with the intent of storing different function needs and ideas found \href{https://github.com/AntonJoha/Lisp/issues/11}{here}.
If anyone happens to find this then feel free to add to it.
